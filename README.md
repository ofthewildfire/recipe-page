## Overview

This is a HTML/CSS challenge and I added a DARK mode toggle because I wanted to use some JavaScript and this was a nice way to add some. I am very happy with the result of the darkmode, however I will continue to refactor.

### What I learned

I learned how to change the color of the bullet points within a list `(ul/ol)` - which I was not aware of till I needed to do it with this challenge. 

```css
li::marker {
  color: "red"
}
```
I think this is pretty neat, I don't know why I thought it was not something that would be easily achievable! 


### Continued development

I will be refactoring to identify all problem areas. :)
